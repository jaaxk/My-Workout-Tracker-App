This is an app I made using the Kivy library that gives me workout of the day based on the .xlsx file in the folder.
It takes an input for each workout of each day and saves it to a CSV file.
The next week, each day it gives me the weights I achieved last week.
At the end, it shows the stats of how much the weight and reps I hit increased from the first to final week.
